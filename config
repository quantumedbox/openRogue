# environment configuration for resolving python stuff without relying on any present (or not present) python version
# paths should be in posix conventions i.e. with '/' as delimiter

# python settings will be evaluated to objects:
# myvar="["test", "test2"]" -> list("test", "test2")

# rewrite system language locale by this setting
language="en_EN"

# path to desirable python executable (otherwise python is picked from PATH or standard ./python directory)
python="./python/pypy3"

# used for jit dll compilation
c_compiler="./tcc/tcc"

# PYTHONPATH of running python subprocess
scriptPath="./scripts"

# should be contained in scriptPath and is used as entry point for execution
