the idea of project is allowing the users and developers full control over distribution and even distributions of other users
engine and all extensions should be able to run on every python realisation and every os that these realisation support
there's always a race between realizations and not every one of them are able to keep up (to CPython)

for python 3 it is prefarable to use at most the 3.7.10 version as PyPy and CPython both support it at the moment
but for extensivly shared modules it might be better to use 3.0 as it could be translated by 3to2 module quite reliebly

python 2 code should also be supported, but mostly by translating it into python 3 code
in some instances python 2 code is desirable, especially when running JPython that could only be used with it
