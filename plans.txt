list of things that have to be done at some point:

. experiment: negate the dll call overhead by making call queues
. way of prepackaging projects for easy distribution
. easy way of inspecting the available resources for users and building for developers
. string method of defining and setting the settings between API and caller
. profiling methods
. catching system signals from standard 'signal' module
. way of pickling to save game states
. 'chance' submodule
. wchar support in config file
. reattachment of nodes and restructuring them accordingly
. register the changes that are made by component integration to give ability to delete them
. libtcod systems integration
. language procgen submodule
. logging
. optional curses backend
. curses based debugging/console interface
. terrain procgen submodule
. tilemap object


priorities:

. interface primitives


in process:

. class-based behaviour setting
. get rid of relative imports


done:

. themes
. events and actions
. use CFFI for API calling
. unified c and python coding styles
. node logic, inheritance model
. graphics layer in SDL2
. text rendering
. cmake lists for building
. context constructors (building system window on /root/ children from UI classes)
. scenes and /root/
. event queuing
