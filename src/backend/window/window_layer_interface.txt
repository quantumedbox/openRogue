openRogue could have different realizations of window contexts, event handling and rendering
but they all should follow the unified interface to work interchangeably


types:

	. Window 	-- 	anything that is used to describing concrete underlying window
					with SDL it's directly SDL_Window* pointer, but other realizations
					could have, for example, special structs to manage windows

definitions:
	
	. EventQueue	-- struct that contains array of events and the len of this array to be used on python side to create event objects

	. WINDOW_SIGNAL -- unified signals of window life cycle such as closing, resizing, gaining focus and etc.



-- Create new window context and return pointer to data that represents windows

Window* init_window(int width, int height, const char* title);



-- Close signals are resolved by Python layer depending on their WINDOW_SIGNAL output

void close_window(Window*);



-- Process all window related events and return bitmask of WINDOW_SIGNALs

WINDOW_SIGNAL process_window(Window*);



-- Forms and returns EventQueue buffer which consists of events belonging to given Window argument

EventQueue* dispatch_window_events(Window*);



-- Clean up allocated event queue

void _free_event_queue(EventQueue*);
